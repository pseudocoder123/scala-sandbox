# Scala Sandox - Consolidated Assigments

This branch contains assignments completed during my journey with Scala, organized day by day. Youâ€™ll find assignment files in folders named `day2`, `day3`, and so on.

- For individual day-specific branches, see the branches named `f-dayX-task` (e.g., `f-day2-task`).
- [Link to the base branch](https://github.com/sakethmuthoju2k/scala-sandbox/tree/base-branch) for overall guidelines.
